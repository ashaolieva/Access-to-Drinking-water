### Project Overview

In this project, I investigate access to safe and affordable drinking water, focusing on inequalities in service levels between different countries
and regions. I used data from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (JMP). The JMP dataset estimates household access to drinking water services between 2000 and 2020 to assess progress toward achieving the United Nations' sixth Sustainable Development Goal(SDG), Water and Sanitation: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.

### Data Understanding and Transformation
In the initial data understanding phase, I did the following:
1. Project overview.
2. Becoming familiar with the dataset.
3. Importing the data.
4. Investigating population size.
5. Investigating access by area.
6. Investigating access by population size.
7. Investigating access by income group.

In the data transformation phase, I did the following:
1. Becoming familiar with the dataset.
2. Investigating year representation.
3. Investigating Annual Rates of Change (ARC).
4. Investigating access by area.
5. Investigating access by region



### Exploratory Data Analysis
The following were the major questions we answered:

- How does the urban population share compare to the rural population?
- What is the tendency and spread of the different water access features?
- What does the urban access to water look like based on urban population size?
- How does the imported dataset differ from the Estimates on the use of water (2020) dataset?
- What is the Annual Rates Change (ARC) for the national, rural, and urban areas per country?
- How does the national population size influence the ARC?


### Data Analysis
Some of the interesting codes/features we worked with are :


### Results or Findings

The analysis results are summarised as follows:

- The percentage difference between the dataset and the estimated world urban population size (the total number of people living in urban areas) for 2020 is 1.70%.
-The distribution of the national basic service feature (wat_bas_n) is more similar to the distribution of the urban basic feature (wat_bas_u) than it is to the national limited feature (wat_lim_n).
- Countries with greater urban population shares are more likely to provide basic water service than countries with smaller ones.
- For population sizes and shares across the different income groups :
   - High-income countries are, on average, more urbanised than low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries.
   - More people included in this dataset live in lower-middle-income countries than in any of the other types of economies.
   - On average, the greater the GNI, the more urbanised.
